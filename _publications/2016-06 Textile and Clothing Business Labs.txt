abstract: >
  The European textile and clothing (henceforth T&C) sector is forced to heavily invest in research and development in order to fight against global competition focused on cheap, fast fashion products. Micro businesses or individuals have trouble keeping up to date with these innovations. TCBL is a Horizon 2020 funded innovation action that started in July 2015 and will run for 4 years. TCBL aims to help the European T&C industry find new business models aimed at sustainability and innovation. Local business labs will help bring people together and offer a place with access to specialized machinery. An online community will be founded and act as a cross-boundary meeting place. A knowledge repository, the Knowledge Spaces, will support people eager to learn or share knowledge, thereby stimulating innovation. Semantic interpretation of the user interactions with the Knowledge Spaces will form the basis for an analytic tool which will help anticipate user needs.
