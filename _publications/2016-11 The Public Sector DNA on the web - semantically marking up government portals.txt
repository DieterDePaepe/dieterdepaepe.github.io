  Base registries contain core public sector data. They are fundamental building blocks in supporting interaction between government and private sector. To enable the private sector to discover, adopt and use information from base registries (e.g. addresses of organizations and public services), the government needs a distribution model. Therefore, the Flemish government is working on a technical strategy to add markup to government portals to embed their ‘DNA’, semantic annotations, on third-party private sector platforms, to dissolve the existing governmental silos and to provide better public services. In this context, this paper reviews a potential strategy to ‘open up’ base registries that combines the best of both worlds: bridging between the schema.org and the European ISA Core vocabularies.
