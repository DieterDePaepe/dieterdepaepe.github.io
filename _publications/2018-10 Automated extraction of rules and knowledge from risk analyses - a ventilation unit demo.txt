abstract: >
  Assessing upfront the causes and effects of failures is an important aspect of system manufacturing. Nowadays, these analyses are performed by a large number of experts. To enable semantic unification and easy operationalization of these risk analyses, this paper demonstrates an approach to automatically map the captured information into an ontology and accompanying rules. The approach is demonstrated with a use case to identify anomalies and their causes within a ventilation unit.
