## My Resume

I graduated in 2010 as a _Master of Science in Computer Science Engineering: Software Engineering_
from [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be).

After graduation, I worked eight months as a _Knowledge Engineer_ in Aktor Knowledge Technology, a former part of the IP & Science technology group of [Thomson Reuters](https://www.thomsonreuters.com).
Here, I helped to further develop and maintain their fully automated trademark matching system,
which processed millions of global trademarks every day.

The next four years were spent at [Comsof](https://comsof.com), a spinoff company of Ghent University,
where I became _Software Architect_ and played a leading role in the development of the FiberPlanIT software and helped train new employees.
I was able to play a major role in the evolution of FiberPlanIT from an inhouse set of tools to a fully commercial software product.

In 2015, I started working as a _researcher_ at the [Internet Technology and Data Science Lab (IDLab)](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en) at iMinds (which later became part of [imec](https://www.imec-int.com)) and Ghent University.
I worked on various projects where I gained experience with internet and semantic technologies,
and ultimately assisted the Flemish Government in the [OSLOÂ²](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/producten-diensten/OSLO2) project to semantically unlock their base registries.
After two years, I became part of the Predictive Analysis for Machine Diagnostics and Healthcare Applications (PreDiCT) group, as it better fitted my PhD that I had started along the way:
a hybrid approach for semantics and machine learning.
